+ looks highly configurable

- master does not build
- typings are incomplete and rudimentary
- uses flow, but there is an issue where they talk about migrating to typescript
- does not look that active


# [react-dag](https://github.com/ajainarayanan/react-dag)
* uses [jsplumb](https://github.com/jsplumb/jsplumb/commits/master)
